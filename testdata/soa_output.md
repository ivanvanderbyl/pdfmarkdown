## RECOMMENDATIONS
  
### 1. Excess Cash Deployment
Issue: The joint savings account (BSB-062-456 67890) currently holds $127,500, which
exceeds your 6-month emergency reserve requirement.
Recommendation: Transfer $75,000 from Commonwealth Bank savings to your Vanguard
investment portfolio (INV-98765-43210) for deployment into diversified fixed income and
equity allocations.
Rationale: Current savings rate (2.85%) is below inflation, creating negative real returns.
2. SMSF Contribution Strategy
Issue: Both members have unutilized concessional contribution caps.
Recommendation: Maximum concessional contributions to Smith Family SMSF
(SF0005-004) of $27,500 per member annually.
Implementation: Coordinate with Sarah Chen on salary sacrifice arrangements. Tax
savings of approximately $8,250 annually per member.
3. Trust Distribution Review
Issue: Smith Family Trust (SF0005-001) distributions have not been optimized for tax
efficiency.
Recommendation: Review annual distributions with consideration for adult children
beneficiaries and income splitting opportunities.
Action Required: Quarterly review meetings prior to EOFY.
4. Investment Portfolio Rebalancing
Issue: Current Vanguard portfolio (INV-98765-43210) has drifted to 75% equities / 25% fixed
income.
Recommendation: Rebalance to target 65% equities / 35% fixed income allocation to
reduce volatility approaching retirement.
Implementation: Authorized under existing Transact access (CFR-ACC001-FA002).
